= Old Code Listing
Luke San Antonio Bialecki <lukesanantonio@gmail.com>

This file documents the old code that has been removed and would require
refactoring if it were to be used again, but may be useful in the future.

== Removed July 27th, 2016
The commit that removed this code will be put here.

=== boatlib
* Defines data structures that describ boat attachments.
* Includes code to load mesh chunks and render a boat based on its attachments.
* It would have probably been better if I had separated the rendering code from
  the data structures themselves in some way.

=== collisionlib
* Defines functions to solve for motion and angular motion based on force and
  torque.
* Includes an implementation of Sweep-and-prune for 3D AABBS.
* Includes code to convert Indexed_Mesh_Data to a vector of triangles that can
  then be used to test intersection.
* The intersection test first converts the triangles to a space where the player
  is a unit sphere.
* Barycentric coordinates are used to get the intersection point on a triangle,
  once the penetration / collision is confirmed.

=== gen
* Procedurally generates terrain on a map grid using simple noise.
* Options like amplitude, frequency and the number of octaves are configurable.
* The Radial_Algorithm takes noise and makes a mass of land surrounded by water.
* The Tree_Gen changes land cells to forest / tree cells.

=== io
* Implements communication with a child process.
* Message-passing like object called Pipe_IO which uses two objects to send data
  to each other.
* Both implementations use the External_IO interface.
* Also includes a C-like interface that child process IO uses in its
  implementation.

=== luaint
* Includes a small wrapper around the Lua API (vanilla, may not work with
  LuaJIT).
* Includes a Lua interface (which may be broken) around map gen and modifying
  the map grid.

=== net
* Implements a networked io implementation of External_IO (from io).
* Implements a client and server protocol for connecting and agreeing on server
  rules / options, but doesn't implement the communication once the client is
  ready to play (nothing like entity interpolation or lag compensation is
  implemented, etc).
* Not sure if the server-side protocol implementation is as well-tested as the
  client side.

=== sail
* Includes code specific to the sailboat game.
* Includes code to parse command line options that were used to specify boat
  attachments.
* Includes code to start a client and a server but I don't believe that code
  worked.

=== snd
* Includes code to play music, but no support to pause it.
* Uses SDL_Audio as a backend.
* Includes code to load a FLAC (synchronously) as PCM_Data.

=== steamlib
* Includes a RAII-style initialization struct for initializing the Steam API,
  although we don't have an ID so it was never used or tested or anything.

=== strat
* Includes code specific to the strategy game.
* Includes code to spread events over time.
* Includes code to maintain a set of structures that were placed on the map.
* Includes code to build walls between two points, by using a bunch of tall wood
  posts.

=== terrain
* Generates a Quadtree of terrain data where each new level is a a more detailed
  mesh taking up 1/4 of the area of its parent.
* Based on
  link:http://www.vertexasylum.com/downloads/cdlod/cdlod_latest.pdf[Continuous
  Distance-Dependent Level of Detail for Rendering Heightmaps]. The
  transitioning between levels is not implemented.

=== ui
* Implements many elements of a user interface.
* Includes code to load the user interface from a JSON file, vaguely based on
  the XML UI files from Android. That is, to get things where you want them, you
  have to use layouts that take their children and arrange them in a
  well-defined way.
* The code is not really very configurable, and probably doesn't work with our
  current method of taking and handling user input (check out input/
  subdirectory).
* Includes code to render text labels with Freetype and takes advantage of a
  glyph cache.
