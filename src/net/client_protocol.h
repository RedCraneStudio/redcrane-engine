  // 1. Client initiates a connection to the server, sends a packet with:
  //    - Highest client and protocol version that it supports
  // 2. Server responds with two booleans. Both true means continue. They
  // corrospond to which version were compatible and which weren't.
  // 3. Client sends to the server the player's name.
  // 4. Server response with:
  //    - Server rules
  //    - All players
  //    - All Teams
  //    - ID of the current client
  //    - Possible place for extensions, etc.
  // 5. Client sends its loadouts to the server
  // 6. The server says the inventory will work or no.
  // 7. Client asks the user which team they would like to join. The server
  // may send updates to the client while the client is picking a team.
  // 8. Client -> Server: This team!
  // 9. Server -> Client: Spawn here, with this orientation, approximately this
  // time, with this *seed*, or no!
  // 10. Client -> Server: Sampled input information with time so that the
  // water can be properly simulated, etc. The simulation will run on both
  // systems. The server should also be sending data to the client of updates
  // from other clients, this state should include inputs from the clients so
  // that our client can rewind and apply inputs given its own state of water.
  // This way, each boat looks proper given each clients (sorta) individual
  // water but they stay sorta in sink
