== Problem
Synchronization of boats and projectiles across the network.

== Requirements
Boats [.line-through]#and projectiles# need to be able to shoot projectiles

== Non-requirements
Boat bouyancy and other visual effects can be derived from a shared seed and
simulated locally by each client in the network.

== Other

Each boat and projectile should be represented as some sort of entity

Entities should have position and speed while acceleration is done on the
server using client input or just physics, in the case of projectiles.

== Connection Protocol

See
https://github.com/RedcraneStudio/redcrane-engine/blob/master/src/net/client.h[net/client.h]
for a description of the protocol
