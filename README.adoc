A highly-WIP C++ game engine that focuses on nothing in particular. Games are
considered "mods" to the engine and are written in Lua

== Developing the engine

If you want to contribute, start by reading link:doc/engine.adoc[this document]. It
goes over important structures, engine architecture and most important of all,
coding style.

Love you all and good luck ;)

=== Installing dependencies on Ubuntu 17.04

    > apt install build-essential cmake libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libsdl2-dev libfreetype6-dev libbullet-dev luajit libluajit-5.1-dev libglew-dev libglm-dev libmsgpack-dev libuv1-dev imagemagick

Other distributions will almost definitely work.

Windows and Mac should work, but they are untested so who knows!

=== Cloning and building

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/lukesanantonio/redcrane-engine.git
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../redcrane-engine -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja
    make

That is only if you are planning to actually do development on the engine.

If you only want to start making your AAA game, you'll probably want to just do
a release build.

    cmake ../redcrane-engine -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

== The Game

=== Running

Currently, a puzzle / story game is being developed alongside the engine. The
code is located in the mildly-cold folder. The survival folder is the remnants
of an old game.

    ./src/redc --config-file=mildly-cold/config.lua --out-log-level=0

The default log level for debug builds is 0, but for a release build you have to
specify.

Oh, and the main (Office.gltf) asset for the mildly-cold game is not currently
version controlled. That will come soon, for now have fun in blender making your
own office!

This being said, these are game files and I can't guarantee they will stay
publicly accessible.

First use https://github.com/lukesanantonio/blendergltf[blendergltf] (sorry, my
changes have not been merged upstream yet). Once you have a glTF file from
blender, use my python script to make it compatible with the engine.

     python engine/convert-scripts/office.py ./Office-pre.gltf ./Office.gltf

Put the Office.gltf in the right place (check mildly-cold/Office-map.json) and
then you should be good to go. Oh and don't forget a collision mesh, otherwise
you'll fall through the floor, and your game won't be any fun.

That is all.

(Try to figure out why we call it mildly-cold).
