Do not crash if a element can not be found and we want to add a click listener to it
Implement Pie Menu
Implement camera rotating with right click drag.

Big:
- Implement some sort of scene graph
  - Replace stuff like the Pie menu which couples rendering and event handling
    functionally with use of this scene graph.
- Remove the Y-flip in UI rendering.
- More centralized triangle functionality. (Combine from circle.h and
  triangle.h)
  - On that note make sure we use consistent value for pi, consistent trig
    functions and sanitize the types used when using our own lib and not glm.
    - Check out the normalize function, the way it returns a double, which
      makes sense but still could be clearer.
  - Define when to use our lib and when to use glm, or just only use glm.
