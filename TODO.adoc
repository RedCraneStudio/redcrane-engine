Listed in order of importance probably.

* Load in glTF maps instead of obj models
* Finish entity interface and implement it
* Move existing code to use mesh_caches and start to use texture caches.
** Make sure the interface allows for reloading of assets on the fly for LOD
   magic or if the context breaks for some reason and we need to reupload
   literally everything.
** This may mean rendering directly through the mesh caches. The data can be
   cached on the disk, cached in memory, or dropped etc, but the clients
   shouldn't care.
** Maybe it's best to just do all these abstractions through the C API?
** How will we manage re-uploading glTF files. Is it possible to just load the
   buffer and keep buffer views (or anything else we need to make sense of the
   data) in memory too?
